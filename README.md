# DeepDive.ai — Backend

This repository contains the backend for **DeepDive.ai**, an AI-powered system design interview platform.

The backend is built with **FastAPI** and exposes asynchronous APIs that manage an interview session state, voice-agent tool call updates, user/problem info and performance evaluation. 

Interview session state is stored in **Redis** to enable fast access and coordination between the client, server, and voice agents. Final interview feedback is generated by an LLM using the full call transcript and a predefined evaluation rubric.
